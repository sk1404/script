# 5. In Vivado, how would you generate a post-implementation timing report and export only the failing paths?

# First, open the implemented design
open_run impl_1

# Generate the timing report for paths with negative slack (failing paths)
report_timing \
  -max_paths 100 \
  -delay_type max \
  -slack_lesser_than 0 \
  -file failing_paths.rpt
